# Angular Workshop
This Project was a two-hour workshop for universities.


Some Notes from the session: 
- Calling an API: use httpClient and make sure to import HttpClientModule
- To add Bootstrap run "npm i bootstrap" and then Add "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css" to styles in angular.json
